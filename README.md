# Welcome
Hello! If you're visiting this humble repo you are likely curious what projects I have up to this point. This repository is an assortment of the Java classes that formed the basis of my basic learning experience in my first year. I don't imagine that it will be particularly impressive, but thank you for stopping by all the same. Seeing as many of these are loose classes they don't all hold a relationship as a project yet. This is also part of my journey understanding Gradle as a build tool, and my first build tool in general.

## Building the Project
If you're interested in running this project to interact with it you will need to have Gradle installed in your system and navigate to the folder location in you Terminal. Once there you can run it with the `gradle run` command.
